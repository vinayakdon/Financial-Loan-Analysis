# Bank Loan Analysis (2021)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes bank loan application data to uncover trends, patterns, and key performance indicators related to loan approvals, funding, and borrower behavior. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on understanding loan distribution over time, borrower characteristics, and overall portfolio performance.

The primary notebook used in this repository is **financialLoanAnalysis2021.ipynb**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze total loan applications and funded amounts  
- Track loan trends by year and month  
- Understand borrower profiles such as employment length, home ownership, and loan purpose  
- Evaluate loan performance using key financial metrics  
- Support data-driven insights for banking and financial decision-making

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset consists of historical bank loan application records with attributes including:
- Loan amount and funded amount  
- Interest rate and installment  
- Loan status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current)  
- Applicant information (employment length, annual income, home ownership)  
- Loan purpose and issue date  

Date fields are converted into datetime format and enhanced with year and month features to support time-series analysis.
